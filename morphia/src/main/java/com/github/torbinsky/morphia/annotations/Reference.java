/**
 * Identifies that a field should be mapped to MongoDB DBRef.
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * If your field's value is a a document that could be
 * stored in more than one collection, DBRef is a solution.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For all other use-cases, use manual linking for performance reasons.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A manual link is simply a field that holds a reference to another
 * entity document that your own application creates and maintains.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * The _id of the referenced document must be a type that the
 * mongo-java-driver natively supports within it's BasicBSONEncoder
 * implementation, Morphia does not (yet) support more complex mapping.
